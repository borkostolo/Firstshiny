<h1 style="color:orange">Welcome on my Shiny App Page</h1>


## About ME 
I was born and raised in Hungary. I graduated here form high school.
After travelling around the world, I arrived to the USA. I liked it here and decided to learn the language and enrolled to college.
Outside of the office I like to spend my time with reading, cooking, running and backpacking to remote places. 


For my professinal experience, please visit my linkedIn page:

### About the Project
Any time I travel I enjoy observing cultures, traditions and  social habbits. Also, pay attention to what nations eat, drink and how healthy they are. 
**Cancer** is one of the main causes of death across the globe. 
There are many researches, experiments ongoing in this field that takes years to see
what is causing cancer to develop in the human body.
